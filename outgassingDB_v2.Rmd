## A Quick Preface  
  
I am excited to be part of the Fall 2018 Class of [NASA Datanauts](https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/)! I'll be using this repo to keep track of my work for this program. I'm currently on **Track 1: Intro to Coding** where I am creating a github project page to diplay live data.

## Outgassing DB Data  
  
The data we are using is from NASA's open data portal and is a compilation of [outgassing data](https://data.nasa.gov/Applied-Science/Outgassing-Db/r588-f7pr) of materials, intended for spacecraft use. The data were obtained at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).    
  
To be honest, I have no idea what outgassing is and what this data means. I found this [blog post](http://mwexpert.typepad.com/rog_blog/2010/11/what-is-outgassing-and-when-does-it-matter.html) to be helpful in explaining the basic concepts in lay language. In short:
   
> Outgassing is a concern for any electronic equipment intended for use in high-vacuum environments. It refers to the release of gas trapped within a solid, such as a high-frequency circuit-board material... In space-based equipment, released gas can condense on such materials as camera lenses, rendering them inoperative.
   
Some variables we see in the data set:  
  
* Total mass loss (TML)    
* Collected volatile condensable materials (CVCM)   
* Water vapor recovered (WVR)
   
   
Our assignment was the following: To tweak the site files to pull Outgassing data from data.nasa.gov via an API onto your site.  
  
This a screenshot of how mine looked:

Success! But, this presentation isn't super user-friendly.
   
   
I figured this would be a good opportunity to play around with this data in R. In particular, I want to learn about working with `.json` files in R (I don't use `.json` files generally so I'm excited to familiarize myself with this file format). Also, for now I am sorta avoiding using javascript (the code for the original exercise was `.js` which you can see in my Archives directory). Hopefully I can develop more javascript knowledge at a later time.

### Packages  
  
Here are the packages I used (I am open to suggestions for other helpful tools!)  
  
```{r, eval=TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(rjson) # Working with .json files in R
library(DT) # We'll use this to make data readable (hopefully!)
```
  

### Loading our data   

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# Data table version
json_data <- fromJSON(file='https://data.nasa.gov/resource/gymh-eyc2.json')
  
```
  
### Creating a data frame {#createdf} 
  
```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Unlist the fromJSON() output
json_unlisted <- lapply(json_data, 
                        function(x) {
  x[sapply(x, is.null)] <- NA
  unlist(x)
})

# Combine our dissected parts of the json file and make it a dataframe
outgassing_df <- as.data.frame(do.call("cbind", json_unlisted))

# how big is our dataframe 
dim(outgassing_df) 
```
  
  
There are a lot of columns, so when I use `head()`, I'm only going to pull the first 6 columns:  
    
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# View the first six rows and columns our dataframe
head(outgassing_df[,1:6])
```

## Formatting our Data  
  
### Transposing the data frame
   
Our dataframe has 1000 columns because of the way it was unlisted. The output of `fromJSON()` is a list.  
  
Using the function `head()`, we see that each material in our dataset is notated as `[[number]]` and has multiple members (i.e. category, cvcm, id). So `[[1]]` has a value for `[[1]]$id` and etc.   

```{r, echo=TRUE}
class(json_data)
json_data[1:2] # See items 1 and 2 in list json_data
```
  
We want to make each material its own list in a dataframe. So we applied `unlist()` on our list and then used `cbind()` to put these lists together in a data frame. We did this when [creating our dataframe](#createdf).  
  
However, this resulted in each material in its own column. It's more intuitive to have each material in its own row. So we can transpose with `t()`.    
  
```{r,echo=TRUE}
head(t(outgassing_df))
```

### Creating a data table   
  
Now we can put our data frame in a table for perusal.  
  
  

```{r, echo=TRUE} 
# Using the DT package:
datatable(t(outgassing_df),options = list(searching=TRUE,pageLength=6))
```
